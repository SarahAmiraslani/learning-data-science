    "### Essential Python Libraries\n",
    "- **NumPy**, short for numerical Python. It provides the data structures and algorithms needd for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python. \n",
    "    - NumPy contains: \n",
    "        - A fast and efficient multidimensional array object *ndarray*\n",
    "        - Functions for performing element-wise computations with arrays or mathematical operations between arrays. \n",
    "        - Tools for reading and writing array-based datasets to disk\n",
    "        - Linear algebra operations\n",
    "    - Beyond the fast array-processing capabilities that NumPy adds to Python, one of its primary uses in data analysis is as a contained for data to be passed between algorithms and libraries. \n",
    "       - For numerical data, NumPy arrays are efficient for storing and manipulating data than the other built in Python data structures. Thus many numerical computing tools for Python either assume NumPy arrays as a primary data structure or they target seamless interoperability with NumPy. \n",
    "       \n",
    "- **pandas** provides high-level data structures and functions designed to make working with structured or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive. The primary objects in pandas are the `DataFrame`, a tabular column-oriented data structure with both row and column labels, and the `Series`, a one dimensional labeled array object. \n",
    "    - pandas blends the high-performance, array-computing ideas of NumPy with the flexible data manipulation capabilities of spreadsheets and relational databases.\n",
    "        - It provides sophisticated insexing functionality to make it easy to reshape, slice and dice, perform aggregations, and select subsets of data.\n",
    "    - Note, as a result of having been built initially to solve finance and business analytics problems, pandas features especially deep time series functionality and tools well suited for working with time-indexed data generated by business processes. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **matplotlib** is the most popular Python library for producing plots and other two-dimensional data visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **SciPy** is a collection of packages addressing a number of different standard problem domains in scientific computing. \n",
    "    - Here are some of the packages included:\n",
    "        - `scipy.integrate` included numerical integaration routines and differential equation solvers. \n",
    "        - `scipy.linalg` includes linear algebra routines and matrix decompositions extending beyond those provided in `numpy.linalg`.\n",
    "        - `scipy.optimize` includes function optimizers (minimizeers) and root finding algorithms. \n",
    "        - `scipy.signal` includes signal processing tools.\n",
    "        - `scipy.sparse` includes sparse matrices and sparse linear system solvers. \n",
    "        - `scipy.stats` includes standard continous and discrete probability distributions (density functions, samplers, continous distribution functions), various statistical tests, and more descriptive statistics. \n",
    "- **scikit-learn** is the premier general-purpose machine learning toolkit in Python. \n",
    "    - It includes submodules for models such as: \n",
    "        - Classification: SVM, nearest neighbors, random forest, logistic regression, etc.\n",
    "        - Regression: Lasso, ridge regression, etc.\n",
    "        - Clustering: k-means, spectral clustering, etc.\n",
    "        - Dimensionality reduction: PCA, feature selection, matrix factorization, etc.\n",
    "        - Model selection: Grid search, cross-validation, metrics\n",
    "        - Preprocessing: Feature extraction, normalization\n",
    "- **statsmodels** is a statistical analysis package that contains algorithms for classical statistics and econometrics. \n",
    "    - It includes submodules such as: \n",
    "        - Regression models: Linear regression, generalized linear models, robust linear models, linear mixed effects models, etc.\n",
    "        - Analysis of variance (ANOVA)\n",
    "        - Time series analysis: AR, ARMA, ARIMA, VAR, and other models\n",
    "        - Nonparametric methods: Kernel density estimation, kernel regression\n",
    "        - Visualization of statistical model results\n",
    "    - statsmodels is more focused on statistical inference, providing uncertainty estimates and p-values for parameters. scikit-learn, by contrast is more prediction-focused. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Data science tasks generally fall into a number of different broad groups:\n",
    "- *Interacting with the outside world*\n",
    "    - Reading and writing with a variety of file formats and data stores\n",
    "- *Preparation*\n",
    "    - Cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, reshaping, slicing and dicing, and transforming data for analysis. \n",
    "- *Transformation*\n",
    "    - Applying mathematical and statistical operations to groups of datasets to derive new datasets. \n",
    "- *Modeling and computation*\n",
    "    - Connecting your data to statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or other computational tools. \n",
    "- *Presentation*\n",
    "    - Creating interactive or static graphical visualizations or textual summaries. \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Import Conventions**\n",

    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "import statsmodels as sm\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: it's considered bad practice in Python software development to import everything from a large package. When you can you should only import what you need. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Jargon**\n",
    "- *Munge/munging/wrangling*\n",
    "    - Describes the process of manipulating unstructured and/or messy data into a structured or clearn form. \n",
    "- *Pseudocode*\n",
    "    - A description of an algorithm or process that takes a code-like form while n ot being actual valid code. \n",
    "- *Syntactic sugar*\n",
    "    - Programming syntax that does not add new features, but makes something more convenient or easier to type.\n",
